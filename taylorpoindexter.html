      <h2>About</h2>
      <p><b>Taylor Poindexter</b> is the co-founder of <a href="https://blackcodecollective.com/"> Black Code Collective </a>, an organization that strives to provide a safe space for Black Engineers to collaborate and grow their skills, while also increasing civic engagement. In addition to this, she is a Senior Back End Engineer for a startup called tech co. - a company that is working to make a more participatory democracy. When asked about what book Taylor would recommend to engineers everywhere, Taylor suggested <a href="https://bookshop.org/books/the-pragmatic-programmer-your-journey-to-mastery-20th-anniversary-edition/9780135957059>">The Pragmatic Programmer</a>. She said, "It's a very popular book, and for good reason. It will change the way you attack problems and make you a more efficient programmer overall."</p>

      <h5> On the day-to-day</h5>
  <p>"On the back end, I'm handling all the data that is passed to the front end for you to be able to see and manipulate. I also write the algorithms to potentially be able to save that data to the database and then serve to the user when they come back."</p></div>
    <div class="challenge">
      <h5>On the challenges</h5>
      <p>"The amount of imposter syndrome I've felt until the last 6 months has been at times overwhelming and there were genuine times when I thought that I couldn't make it in tech."" </p></div>
  <div class="mentors">
    <h5>On mentorship</h5>
    <p>"I have several mentors I've picked up along the way but they've all happened very naturally. And I think those are the best types of mentor relationships because they genuinely care about the advancement of my career."</p></div>
